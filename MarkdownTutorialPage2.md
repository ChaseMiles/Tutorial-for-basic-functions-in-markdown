# **How to Create Different Sized Headers**
* ## This is an H2 tag! 
* To create different sized tags, you must use the # symbol.
* The number of #'s determines the size of header. For example: #### would be an H4 tag.
***
# **Inserting Links** 
* Name the hyperlink by using []. For example: [Link to Google!] 
* After completing the hyperlink, insert the URL immediately after, using parenthesis (). For example (https://www.google.com)
* The completed function should look like this: [Link to Google!](https://www.google.com)

# **Creating Lists** 

## Unordered List 
* To start a list add two asterisks before and after your header to bold your topic. 
* Just add one asterisk for each subject line after your header to create bullets!
  * To create a sub-bullet, hit the tab button once before you insert an asterisk!
  * Creating lists are very simple! 

## Numbered List 
1. To start a numbered list, just simply add the number 1 followed by a period, before each subject line. For example: "1."
1. The confusing part for a numbered list is that you must keep inserting "1." before each subject line regardless of what number that certain subject line may be. 
1. To clear the confusion, you will type "1." before you type out your subject line each time, but the result will come out 1. 2. 3. 4. and so on.

# **Bold and Italicized Text** 

## Bold Text
* To make a word or sentence bold, add 2 asterisks before and after what you would like to bold. Also, make sure there is not a space between the asterisk and the first letter and last letter of the subject. For example: **Hello!**
* You can also replace the asterisks with 2 underscores and have the same outcome. 

## Italicized Text 
* To make a word or sentence in italics, only add 1 asterisk before and after the text you would like to italicize. Just like making text bold, make sure there is no space between the asterisk and the first letter and last letter of the subject. For example: *Hello!*
* You can also replace the asterisk with 1 underscore and have the same outcome.
